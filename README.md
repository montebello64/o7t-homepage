# Nginx HTTP server and reverse proxy (nginx) S2I Sample Application

This is a very basic sample application repository that can be built and deployed
on [OpenShift](https://www.openshift.com) using the [Nginx HTTP server and a reverse proxy builder image](https://github.com/sclorg/nginx-container).

The application serves static html pages via nginx.
